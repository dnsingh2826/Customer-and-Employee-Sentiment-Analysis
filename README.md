**# Customer-and-Employee-Sentiment-Analysis**

This project analyzes customer &amp; employee reviews from various online platforms using NLP to classify sentiments. The resulting dashboard provides insights into public perception, empowering stakeholders &amp; investors to make informed decisions.

**Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**

- **Web Scraping:** Automated scripts are employed to extract reviews from the specified online platforms. These scripts target relevant keywords or phrases related to the company and its products or services.
- **Data Cleaning:** The scraped data undergoes a thorough cleaning process to remove noise, such as HTML tags, special characters, and irrelevant information.
- **Normalization:** Text data is normalized to ensure consistency, including stemming and lemmatization.

**Sentiment Analysis Model**

- **Custom NLP Model:** A tailored NLP model is developed to accurately classify the sentiment of each review into three categories: positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Training and Evaluation:** The model is trained on a labeled dataset of reviews with known sentiments. Rigorous evaluation techniques are used to assess its performance and make necessary adjustments.
- **Feature Engineering:** Relevant features are extracted from the text data, such as sentiment indicators, n-grams, and part-of-speech tags, to enhance the model's accuracy.

**Dashboard Development**

- **Power BI Integration:** The sentiment analysis results are integrated into a Power BI dashboard, providing a visually appealing and interactive interface for stakeholders.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** The dashboard displays key metrics, including the overall sentiment distribution, sentiment trends over time, and sentiment analysis by category (e.g., customer satisfaction, employee morale).
- **Visualization:** Various visualizations, such as bar charts, line graphs, and word clouds, are used to present the sentiment data in a clear and understandable manner.
- **Filtering and Customization:** The dashboard allows users to filter the data by specific criteria (e.g., review source, sentiment category, time period) to gain tailored insights.
